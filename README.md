### Data set
The data set is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/). 

The following is the information of the data set:
	
**Name**: Individual household electric power consumption Data Set

**Source**: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption 

**Description**: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

**Attribute Information**:

1. Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
2. Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
3. Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
4. Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
5. Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
6. Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
7. Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
8. Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
9. Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

### Plot4.R

To run the four plotting scripts (Plot1.R, Plot2.R, Plot3.R, Plot4.R), you need to download the data (household_power_consumption.txt) from source (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption) and put it in the "Data" directory in your working directory. Then you have to create the "Figures" folder. After that you can run the scripts. 
When sourced, four png pictures (Plot1.png, Plot2.png, Plot3.png, Plot4.png) will be generated automatically in the "Figures" folder.
* Plot1.R will generate Plot1.png
* Plot2.R will generate Plot2.png
* Plot3.R will generate Plot3.png
* Plot4.R will generate Plot4.png
